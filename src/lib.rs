//! Bevy ECS Tilemap plugin is a ECS driven tilemap rendering library. It's designed to be fast and highly customizable. Each tile is considered a unique entity and all tiles are stored in the game world.
//!
//!
//! ## Features
//! - A tile per entity.
//! - Fast rendering using a chunked approach.
//! - Layers and sparse tile maps.
//! - GPU powered animations.
//! - Isometric and Hexagonal tile maps.
//! - Initial support for Tiled file exports.
//! - Support for isometric and hexagon rendering.
//! - Built in animation support  â€“ see [`animation` example](https://github.com/StarArawn/bevy_ecs_tilemap/blob/main/examples/animation.rs).
//! - Texture array support.
